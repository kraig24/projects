This is a popular project used by UC Berkley's AI class in order to teach foundational AI algorithms such as Alpha-Beta Pruning, Min-Max, and various local search algorithms.

In this project, the goal is to write an AI algorithm that leads PACMAN to collect all of the dots without being touched by the ghosts. The faster the program is solved, the better your application. For this, I used a combination of min-max and local search algorithms to find the fastest results. Virtually, Pacman can only every move in four directions (North, West, South, East). By turning these choices into a tree structure, I used pruning to figure out which choices should never be chosen, and in aggregate, their children never needed to be checked. Afterwards, I  used local search to make sure my program would not get stuck in a false success thinking no fruit was left when, in reality, they were just outside of the scope of the AI player.

Avoiding ghosts was the most challenging part. To do this, I added a heuristic to each position. The AI was trained to go towards a move if it had the highest heuristic value, being eaten by a ghost would result in a -9999 heuristic. By doing this, Pacman would almost always avoid the ghost's direction because he would analyze their possible movements in the state tree above.

Overall, this was a fun project to build and learn more about the foundations of artificial intelligence.
