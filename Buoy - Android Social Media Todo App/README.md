Buoy is an application that allows people to add friends, see what they have going on in their todo lists, and send positive encouragement when
those deadlines are coming up. Tese stickers are sent as notifications, and increase the likelihood that the task will be completed. Of course, 
one can also make their own to do listsa nd cross them off. If you do enough tasks of the same category, you will be awarded a title for everyone
to see and gawk over your awesomeness. Take a look at the video for a full walkthrough by my team.
